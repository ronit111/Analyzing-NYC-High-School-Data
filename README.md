# Guided-Project--Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets. Over the last three missions, we combined the following data sets into a single, clean pandas dataframe:

SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
Class size - Information on class size for each school
AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
Demographics - Demographic information for each school
School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.

 Here are some potential next steps:

Determing wheter there's a correlation between class size and SAT scores
Figuring out which neighborhoods have the best schools
If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools.
Investigating the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys.
Assigning scores to schools based on sat_score and other attributes.
